Cyber security is something that controls networks, protects your devices, data and systems from any possing threats it faces. cyber security is basiclly monitoring everything making sure nothing wrong is happening its goal is too prevent any cyber attacks from occuring since cyber crime is big in many parts of the world. Some certifications you may need to be in cyber sercurity are COMPTIA A+ and COMPTia Linux + you probably think you will never need cyber security but there are over 2 biliion password leaks every year but cyber security can stop that. Most of the knowledge you gain from cyber security are things that try to prevent things from happening like spamming, ddosing amd spoofing.
